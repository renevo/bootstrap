# Bootstrap Package

Package to bootstrap my projects, this really just takes care of a lot of the duplicate work, so I don't need to do it every single time.

## Usage

Use at your own risk, not intended for external usage, but hey, its on the internet.

## Grafana Cloud

These things are wired up with Open Telemetry, and my primary use case is Grafana Cloud.
